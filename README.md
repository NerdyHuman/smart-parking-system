# 🅿️ Smart Parking System

A simple and functional smart parking system made using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This was built as a hands-on learning project to simulate a real-world parking lot management system.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🚗 20 parking slots
- ⏱️ Tracks entry and exit time of each vehicle
- 💸 Calculates parking cost (₹50/hour)
- 📂 Stores parking data in browser memory
- 📋 View live updates of parked slots
- ✅ Fully frontend-based – no backend required

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. Click on an empty slot to **park a vehicle**.
2. The system stores the **entry timestamp**.
3. When removing the vehicle, the system:
   - Captures **exit time**
   - Calculates **total hours parked**
   - Multiplies it by ₹50/hour
4. Logs are visible and refresh automatically.

## 📦 Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS (basic styling, responsive)
- JavaScript (vanilla – no libraries)

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Allow user to enter vehicle number
- Export logs to CSV or JSON
- Add a backend to store history
- Login/Authentication for admin
