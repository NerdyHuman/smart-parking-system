Smart Parking System
This is a basic parking management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was made as a small project to learn how to manage dynamic data in the browser and simulate real-life parking logic.

The system lets you manage up to 20 parking slots. When a car is added, it stores the entry time, and once removed, it calculates how long it was parked and the total cost (₹50/hour). All timings are stored locally, and the layout is kept clean and simple.

Features
20 parking slots available
Add a vehicle to a slot with timestamp
Remove vehicle and calculate total cost
Logs entry and exit times
Cost calculated at ₹50/hour
Data stored temporarily in browser memory (can be extended to file or backend)
Simple responsive interface


 How It Works
Select a slot and click "Park Vehicle".
The system logs the time and marks it as occupied.
When the vehicle is removed, it calculates the time difference and cost.
Everything runs in-browser using vanilla JavaScript.
Future Improvements (if I ever get to it )
Export logs to file or connect to a real backend

Add license plate input for better tracking
Login for admin view
Store records permanently
